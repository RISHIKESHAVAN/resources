## Some other continuous distributions:  student-t, the chi-squared, 
## the exponential, the gamma and the beta distribution.
## R provides functions to compute the density, the quantiles, the cumulative 
## distribution function, and to generate Monte Carlo simulations
## for all these distributions.
## d - density, q - quantile, p - pdf, r - random
## norm - normal dist, t - student-t
