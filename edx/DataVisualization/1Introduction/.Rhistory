## instead of loading the entire tidyverse.
## ggplot2 uses a grammar of graphics (gg) to break plots into building blocks
## that have intuitive syntax, making it easy to create relatively complex and
## aesthetically pleasing plots with relatively simple and readable code.
## ggplot2 is designed to work exclusively with tidy data (rows are observations
## Creating a plot:
## The first step in creating a ggplot graph is to define a ggplot object.
## We do this with a function ggplot, which initializes the graph. If we read the
## data file for this function, we see that the first argument is used to specify
## what data is associated with the object. This is the data component.
## So to initiate an object, we can type ggplot data equals murders, this
## associates the data set with the plotting object.
ggplot(data = murders)
## Throughout the series, we will create plots with the ggplot2 package.
## ggplot2 is part of the tidyverse suite of packages, which you can load with:
library(tidyverse).

## We say murders piped into ggplot.Know that this code renders a plot.
## In this case, a blank slate since no geometry has been defined. The only style
## we see is a gray background. What we have just done is that we have created an
## object and because it was not assigned, it was automatically evaluated.
## This is why we saw that gray slab. But note that we can define an object.
## For example, like this.
p <- ggplot(data = murders)
## Here we're assigning the graph object to the object p. If we look at the class
## of p, we see that it's a ggplot object.
class(p)
## To render the plot associated with this object, we simply print the object p.
