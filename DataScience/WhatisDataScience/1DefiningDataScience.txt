♦ What is Data Science?
- Data science is the field of exploring, manipulating, and analyzing data, and using data to answer questions or make recommendations.
- So, what is the process of data science? 
	> Many organizations will use data science to focus on a specific problem, and so it's essential to clarify the question that the organization wants answered. 
	> This first and most crucial step defines how the data science project progresses. Good data scientists are curious people who ask questions to clarify the business need. 
	> The next questions are: "what data do we need to solve the problem, and where will that data come from?". Data scientists can analyze structured and unstructured data from many sources, and depending on the nature of the problem, they can choose to analyze the data in different ways. Using multiple models to explore the data reveals patterns and outliers; sometimes, this will confirm what the organization suspects, but sometimes it will be completely new knowledge, leading the organization to a new approach. 
	> When the data has revealed its insights, the role of the data scientist becomes that of a storyteller, communicating the results to the project stakeholders. Data scientists can use powerful data visualization tools to help stakeholders understand the nature of the results, and the recommended action to take.
